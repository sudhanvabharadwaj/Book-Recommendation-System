# Book-Recommendation-System

ReadMind is a collaborative filtering-based Book Recommendation System built with Python and Streamlit. It leverages user ratings and book metadata to suggest books tailored to your interests. The system uses machine learning techniques to analyze user preferences and recommend similar books, providing an engaging and personalized reading experience.

## Features
üìö Personalized Book Recommendations: Get book suggestions based on your favorite titles.
üîç Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes user ratings to find books you‚Äôll love.
üñºÔ∏è Book Cover Display: See book covers alongside recommendations for a visually rich experience.
‚ö° Interactive Web App: Built with Streamlit for a fast, modern, and responsive UI.
üõ†Ô∏è Retrainable Model: Easily retrain the recommendation engine with new data using the web interface.
üê≥ Docker Support: Ready-to-deploy with Docker for seamless cloud or local deployment.

## How It Works
Data Ingestion: Loads and processes book ratings and metadata.
Model Training: Uses collaborative filtering (KNN) to learn user-book relationships.
Recommendation: Given a selected book, the system finds and displays similar books with their covers.
Retraining: The model can be retrained from the UI to incorporate new data.
